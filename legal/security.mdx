OpSync is built with security at its core. As a platform handling sensitive healthcare data, we take our responsibility to protect your information seriously.

## Infrastructure Security

### Hosting Partners

OpSync is built on industry-leading cloud infrastructure providers:

- **Supabase** - Database hosting with enterprise-grade PostgreSQL, automatic backups, and encryption at rest
- **Fly.io** - Application hosting with isolated compute instances and global edge deployment
- **Vercel** - Frontend hosting with automatic HTTPS, DDoS protection, and edge caching

Database hosting is located in Australian data centres to maintain data sovereignty.

### Network Security

- All data transmitted between your browser and our servers is encrypted using TLS 1.2+
- API endpoints are protected against common attack vectors (SQL injection, XSS, CSRF)
- Regular security updates and patching of all infrastructure components

## Access Controls

### Production Data Access

Production data access is restricted to essential personnel only. Access is:

- Granted on a need-to-know basis
- Logged and auditable
- Reviewed periodically

### Authentication

- **Practice users:** Secure authentication with session management
- **Patient accounts:** Multi-factor authentication (MFA) available for patient portal access
- **Admin users:** Role-based access controls limiting actions based on user permissions

## Data Protection

### Encryption

- **In transit:** All data encrypted using TLS 1.2+
- **At rest:** Database encryption using AES-256

### Backups

- Automated daily backups with point-in-time recovery
- Backups managed by Supabase infrastructure

### Data Retention

- Your data remains yours and is retained while your account is active
- We retain only what is required for legal and regulatory compliance

## Monitoring & Incident Response

### Application Monitoring

- Error tracking and session replay across all applications
- Structured application logging with request tracing
- Queue job monitoring with automated failure alerts
- Periodic health checks on database connectivity and system status

### Incident Response

We maintain documented incident response procedures and will notify affected practices within 72 hours as required by Australian privacy law.

## Compliance Roadmap

We are committed to continuous improvement of our security posture:

| Initiative | Status |
|------------|--------|
| Australian data residency | Complete |
| Encryption at rest and in transit | Complete |
| Role-based access controls | Complete |
| MFA for patient accounts | Complete |
